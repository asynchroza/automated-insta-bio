The world's mine, I just say, "Fuck it, let it turn"
Got one shot and one chance to take it once
Can't really hear what the people are saying
All I wanna do is the most. Backflip off the rope, sky hook when I'm in the post.
I'm gettin' faded 'til the angels comin'. Skippin' all the famous functions.
I don't do no lunchin', I just lunge in
It's a piece of cake. It's a pizza slice.
So many bangers never see the light.
I'm just tryna sip and you'rะต talkin' politics.
'Scuse me darling what's your name?
That's my government never call me that again
The more you sweat in peace the less you bleed in war
